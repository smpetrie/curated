  - What are our core human values?
  - How communication mediums affect society's values,
  - What sort of society we would like to create, and how to create it.

  - What effects will AI have on society?

### Why a short, curated list rather than a feed?

Short, hand-crafted lists of useful resources will hopefully provide an efficient way for you to come across some interesting ideas, with far less online noise getting in your way.

Sure, a short, curated list won't include up-to-date thoughts and current events in the way a social media feed would.
But I'm hoping that's actually a feature, not a bug.

The goal is to help you find a few golden nuggets of potentially useful or insightful ideas.
