subtitle: What this site contains and why I made it
---

This site contains a curated list of online resources that I've found useful over the years.

Topics include:

- How to learn piano (because [piano rocks](https://youtu.be/c8iYkkWdDZw?t=199)),
- Understanding core human values. This includes attempts to understand:
  - What are our core human values?
  - How communication mediums affect society's values,
  - What sort of society would we like to create?
- AI:
  - What effects will AI have on society?

### Why short, curated lists, rather than Social Media posts?

Hopefully the curated lists on this website will present you with a useful idea or two.

But why did I create my own website rather than using social media? A few reasons come to mind:

- No ads.
- Not up-to-date: This one sounds like a bug, but some people might find it to be more of a feature --- i.e. hopefully there is less algorithmic noise, less recency bias, and more focus on ideas that persist through time.
- It's been fun to make. If you want to make your own website like this, I made it using [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll#readme).

Struthless was also influential in my decision to create the website, particularly his thought-provoking and inspirational video on [creating things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n8W6CBxc64).
