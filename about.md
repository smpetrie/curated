subtitle: What this site contains and why I made it
---

This site contains a curated list of online resources I've found useful over the years. 

Topics include:

- How to learn piano
- Understanding core human values. This includes attempts to understand:
  - What are our core human values?
  - How communication mediums affect society's values,
  - What sort of society we would like to create, and how to create it.
- AI:
  - What effects will AI have on society?

### Why a short, curated list rather than a feed?

Hopefully the fact that this website contains a short, curated list of useful resources will mean that you can be linked in quickly with relevant, useful information quickly.
The hope is to help you to identify useful information above the online noise.

Sure, a short, curated list won't include the people's very latest thoughts like a social media feed would.
But that may actually be [a feature, not a bug](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/it%27s_not_a_bug,_it%27s_a_feature).
In a world of too much information, places that contain less information and fewer ideas will hopefully help save people time, reduce wasted mental efforted, and help people to communicate their ideas more effectively across society.
