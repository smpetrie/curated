subtitle: What this site contains and why I made it

This site contains a curated list of online resources that I've found useful over the years.

Topics include:

- How to learn piano (because [piano rocks](https://youtu.be/c8iYkkWdDZw?t=199)),
- Understanding core human values. This includes attempts to understand:
  - What are our core human values?
  - How communication mediums affect society's values,
  - What sort of society would we like to create?
- AI:
  - What effects will AI have on society?

### Why a short, curated list rather than a feed?

Hopefully the curated lists on this website will present you with a useful idea or two.

But why did I create my own website rather than using social media?
Sure, this website won't include up-to-date thoughts and current events in the way a social media feed would.
But I'm hoping that's actually a feature, not a bug --- less algorithmic noise, less recency bias, more focus on ideas that persist through time.
