This site contains a curated list of online resources that I've found useful over the years. 

Topics include:

- How to learn piano
- Understanding core human values. This includes attempts to understand:
  - What are our core human values?
  - How communication mediums affect society's values,
  - What sort of society would we like to create?
- AI:
  - What effects will AI have on society?

### Why a short, curated list rather than a feed?

Sure, a short, curated list won't include up-to-date thoughts and current events in the way a social media feed would.
But I'm hoping that's actually a feature, not a bug --- less algorithmic noise, less recency bias, more ideas that have stood the test of time.

Hopefully you can find a useful idea or two.
