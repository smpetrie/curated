### Why a short, curated list rather than a feed?

Sure, a short, curated list won't include up-to-date thoughts and current events in the way a social media feed would.
But I'm hoping that's actually a feature, not a bug --- less algorithmic noise, less recency bias, more ideas that have stood the test of time.

Hopefully you can find a useful idea or two.
