It turns out learning a musical instrument is possible at any age.
There are even [some advantages to starting later in life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDukvWxLlVk).

I've been learning piano over the last couple of years by watching piano-learning tutorials on YouTube, then playing piano on an second-hand digital piano (I bought it for $500 AUD, but you can get one for closer to $100 AUD).
I usually play for about 10 minutes a day, most days, and it's been heaps of fun.

If you're looking to learn, you only need to set aside about 5 or 10 minutes a day.
Just try to do that most days, and you'll pick things up pretty quickly.

Note that I don't receive any benefits or kickbacks from the below Channels --- I'm just sharing these videos because I think they're great.
